###### INSTRUCTIONS FOR BSRLINUX SERVER -- KNIGHT BSR
###### AUTHOR: Jessica Minnier
###### DATE: November 22, 2017
####################################################################################

# To access the bsrlinux server you must be inside the ohsu firewall (either on campus or VPN)

# you can access Partek on the website
# http://bsrlinux.ohsu.edu/
# NOTE: ONLY ONE USER CAN BE RUNNING TASKS AT ONE TIME

# to transfer files into the server from your computer via a
# file transfer program such as FileZilla or Cyberduck, use the ssh/sftp protocol to
# connect to bsrlinux and transfer files from computer to bsrlinux


####################################################################################
###### TRANSFER FILES USING A TERMINAL
####################################################################################

# you can also transfer files using a terminal window (use a terminal client like Putty on Windows)

# SSH into bsrlinux server with USERNAME as your ohsu username:

ssh USERNAME@bsrlinux
# then enter OHSU password

# this puts you in your personal exacloud home directory ~/ which only you can access
# you can see what files are there with
ls

# to get to the bsrlinux server directory you can switch to:
cd /home/groups/bsrlinux/

# this is where the data files should live
# when the data is located here, Partek can "find" the 
# data when you upload it into a project via the software
# WARNING: only save data in a folder 2-3 folder levels below FlowData
# or Partek will not be able to find it
cd /home/groups/bsrlinux/flow/FlowData

# The person who will be running the project should upload the data, or the uploader
# should change the permissions of the data to allow another user to write/execute/read
cd FOLDERWITHDATA
chmod 777 *fastq.gz
# this works but will make data PUBLIC, we need to fix this so that BSR is a group on here

# to transfer files from another server such as nix (MPSSR server), you can ssh into that server,
# cd to the directory where the data lives on that server, and use rysnc to transfer from
# the server to bsrlinux, where data_directory is the name of the folder you wish to transfer: 
rsync -rv data_directory USERNAME@bsrlinux:/home/groups/bsrlinux/flow/FlowData/
