Information about how to use BSRlinux

This folder/repo can be found on github: https://github.com/ohsu-knight-cancer-biostatistics/bsrlinux
Please use git/github for tracking changes to these files. This is most easily done by opening the [bsrlinux.Rproj](bsrlinux.Rproj) file in Rstudio.

Useful files:

- Unix server instructions: [bsrlinux_instructions.txt](bsrlinux_instructions.txt)
- Managing packages on Rstudio server: [rstudio_server_instructions.R](rstudio_server_instructions.R)
with rendered version: [rstudio_server_instructions.md](rstudio_server_instructions.md)
- in [Filezilla_screenshots](Filezilla_screenshots/) folder there are screenshots showing how to set up a remote sftp connection to the server using Filezilla (specifically this shows an example from a Remote Desktop session in the Windows server). Cyberduck is another useful program (especially for Mac) that can do this.
- in [Rstudioserver_screenshots](Rstudioserver_screenshots/) there is a screenshot of how to change the directory to bsrlinux server's directory (since default is ACC home `~/`)
