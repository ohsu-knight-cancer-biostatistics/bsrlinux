###### INSTRUCTIONS FOR BSRLINUX SERVER -- KNIGHT BSR
###### AUTHOR: Jessica Minnier

####################################################################################

# To access the bsrlinux server you must be inside the ohsu firewall (either on campus or VPN)

# you can access Rstudio server on the website
# https://bsrlinux.ohsu.edu/rstudio/

# to transfer files into the server from your computer via a
# file transfer program such as WinSCP or Cyberduck, use the ssh/sftp protocol to
# connect to your home folder on ACC (~/) and transfer files from computer to that folder
# or, you can transfer files to the bsrlinux server itself (recommended for larger data files) /home/groups/bsrlinux/


####################################################################################
###### TRANSFER FILES USING A TERMINAL
####################################################################################

# you can also transfer files using a terminal window (use a terminal client like Putty on Windows)

# SSH into bsrlinux with USERNAME as your ohsu username:

ssh USERNAME@bsrlinux

# then enter OHSU password

# this puts you in your personal ACC home directory ~/ which only you can access
# you can see what files are there with (THIS IS NOT THE SERVER, these files are located on ACCâ€™s computers)
ls

# to CREATE a folder to hold your R packages (only do this once):
mkdir ~/Rlib

# to view contents of your Rlib
ls ~/Rlib

# to get to the bsrlinux server directory you can switch to:
cd /home/groups/bsrlinux/
# Now you are looking at files on the server

# To make a file read/writeable by our group:
chmod 775 FILENAME

# To make a folder and all of its contents read/writeable by our group:
chmod -R 775 FOLDERNAME

# to get back to home directory:
cd ~/

# to edit your .Rprofile (i.e. to add ~/Rlib to your .libPaths())
nano ~/.Rprofile

# to transfer files from another server such as nix (MPSSR server), you can ssh into that server,
# cd to the directory where the data lives on that server, and use rysnc to transfer from
# the server to bsrlinux, where data_directory is the name of the folder you wish to transfer: 
rsync -rv data_directory USERNAME@bsrlinux:/home/groups/bsrlinux/YOURFOLDER
